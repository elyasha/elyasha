### Hi there, I'am Matheus Elyasha ðŸ‘‹

I am a double degree student at [CentraleSupÃ©lec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr) (FR) and [University of BrasÃ­lia](https://www.unb.br) (BR), but currently, I am working at EDF as a software engineer. Also, I am passionate about new solutions and creating good software that has value for humanity, that is the reason why I created [Code & Coffee 55](https://github.com/codeandcoffee55). Nowadays, I am its current CEO and I look forward to a good future at the Web Development community. In my free time, I am a Data Analyst at [BRASA](https://github.com/gobrasa).

Code & Coffee 55 has its name due to the phone numbers in Brazil (+55 ...). It is originally a Brazilian company for high level web and mobile development.
